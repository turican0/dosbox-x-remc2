            notes "Microsoft recommends using INT 21/AH=4Ch for DOS 2+. This function sets the program's return code (ERRORLEVEL) to 00h. Execution continues at the address stored in INT 22 after DOS performs whatever cleanup it needs to do (restoring the INT 22,INT 23,INT 24 vectors from the PSP assumed to be located at offset 0000h in the segment indicated by the stack copy of CS, etc.). If the PSP is its own parent, the process's memory is not freed; if INT 22 additionally points into the terminating program, the process is effectively NOT terminated. Not supported by MS Windows 3.0 DOSX.EXE DOS extender" citation rbil;

            /* The <<:"_EOF" .. "_EOF":>> syntax is loosely based on bash shell semantics as a way to support large multi-line string constants without having to escape all the time.
               However it is <<:"_EOF" .. "_EOF":>> to ensure it cannot be confused with expression syntax and to make it more explicit the beginning and end. */
            notes <<:"_EOF" Terminates the current process. This is one of several methods that a program can use to perform a final exit. MS-DOS then takes the following actions:

    All memory belonging to the process is released.
    File buffers are flushed and any open handles for files or devices owned by the process are closed.
    The termination handler vector (Int 22H) is restored from PSP:000AH.
    The Ctrl-C handler vector (Int 23H) is restored from PSP:000EH.
    [2.0+] The critical-error handler vector (Int 24H) is restored from PSP:0012H.
    Control is transferred to the termination handler.

If the program is returning to COMMAND.COM, control transfers to the resident portion, and the transient portion is reloaded if necessary. If a batch file is in progress, the next line of the file is fetched and interpreted; otherwise, a prompt is issued for the next user command.

    Any files that have been written to using FCBs should be closed before performing this exit call; otherwise, data may be lost.
    [3.0+] If the program is running on a network, it should remove all locks it has placed on file regions before terminating. "_EOF":>> citation msdncd92;

If the standard input is not redirected, and the character read is a Ctrl-C, an Int 23H is executed. If the standard input is redirected, a Ctrl-C is detected at the console, and BREAK is ON, an Int 23H is executed.

    To read extended ASCII codes (such as the special function keys F1 to F10) on the IBM PC and compatibles, you must call this function twice. The first call returns the value 00H to signal the presence of an extended code.

            notes <<:"_EOF" [1] Reads a character from the first serial port.
[2.0+] Reads a character from the standard auxiliary device. The default is the first serial port (COM1).

	In most MS-DOS systems, the serial device is unbuffered and is not interrupt-driven. If the auxiliary device sends data faster than your program can process it, characters may be lost.
	At startup on the IBM PC, PC-DOS initializes the first serial port to 2400 baud, no parity, 1 stop bit, and 8 data bits. Other implementations of MS-DOS may initialize the serial device differently.
	There is no way for a user program to read the status of the auxiliary device or to detect I/O errors (such as lost characters) through this function call. On the IBM PC, more precise control can be obtained by calling ROM BIOS Int 14H or by driving the communications controller directly.

	If a Ctrl-C is detected at the keyboard, an Int 23H is executed.
	[2.0+] You can also input from the auxiliary device by requesting a read (Int 21H Function 3FH) using the predefined handle for the standard auxiliary device (0003H) or using a handle obtained by opening the logical device AUX. "_EOF":>> citation msdncd92;
